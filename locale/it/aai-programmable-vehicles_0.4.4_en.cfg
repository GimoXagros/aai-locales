[entity-description]
vehicle-depot=Rapidly transfer items to and from nearby vehicles based on signal input. Set a positive item signal to accept that item from vehicles. Set a negative signal to supply that item to vehicles.
vehicle-depot-combinator=Set signals here or connect to a network to set the depot's exchange settings.
vehicle-deployer=Deploys a car-type vehicle. Any connected signal data is saved to the vehicle as it is deployed otherwise vehicle defaults are used. Vehicle Signal data is used for the vehicle's item target quantities so that Hauler vehicles can exchange inventory if in range (inventory over that value will be pushed to a hauler if it will accept it). Signal data on Haulers defines their maximum capacity instead of target amount.
vehicle-deployer-combinator=Set signals here or connect to a network to set the deployed unit data.
unit-scan=Input Vehicle ID or Player ID (Virtual Signals Tab), selects the nth entity of that type in order of placement or use a negative value to select in reverse order (most recent first). Outputs 'count' of entities of that type and details of the selected entity including position, health, inventory, and internal timers.

vehicle-depot=Rapidly transfer items to and from nearby vehicles based on signal input. Set a positive item signal to accept that item from vehicles. Set a negative signal to supply that item to vehicles.
unit-remote-control=Select vehicles with normal drag. Send a pathfinding command with shift-click (uses biter ai so can be a bit derpy). Shift-click distributes commands over the selected area, larger areas mean less units bumping in to each other. If vehicles are given a new command by a Unit Control Tower after your command then your command will be overriden.
cannon-shell-precision=Like the Cannon Shell but targets single target instead of a line for reduced collateral damage.

vehicle-deployment=Automatically deploy a vehicle from a vehicle item. The attached combinator allows you to set the UnitData vehicles are deployed with so you can change their inventory exchange settings.
vehicle-depot=Vehicles can quickly drop or pickup items from here. Inventory change is based on the vehicle's UnitData and the Depot's Exchanged Settings (combinator).
programmable-structures=Scan tiles to detect resources, enemies, and structures. Place zones automatically at coordinates. Scan zone tile positions.
programmable-vehicle-structures=Scan vehicle position status and inventory. Send vehicle commands automatically sending them in a specific direction, to coordinates, or to follow a player or other vehicle. Scan or set UnitData to change vehicle memory and change inventory exchange settings.
